/*
    Project Definition: Dynamic Memory Allocation

    Develop a simple crud Opertaion in linked list with the help of C++ that will help you to
    understand system and memory tp provide dynamically.

    Project Criteria:
    Requirements:
        - Class & Object
        - Constructors
        - Methods

    Class Structure:
    1. Base Class: Dynamic Memory Allocation
        Attributes:
            - New node
            - Next node
            - Head
        Methods:
            - insert_at_beginning(data)
            - Search(key)
            - Delete_node(key)
            - reverse()
    
    Requirements:
    1. Basic Linked List Implementation.
    2. Insert at Beginning & Search Operation.
    3. Deletion of a Node.
    4. Reversing the Linked List.
